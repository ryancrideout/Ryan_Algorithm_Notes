    "The MVC Pattern, known as \"Model, View, Controller\" Pattern, is a software architectural pattern, commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected element. This is primarily used to make a distinction of how data is handled on the back end versus how data is presented to the user. In other words, MVC is about _efficiently relating_ the user interface to underlying data models and making the application code relate to this.\n",

So for example, if you were on a website and queried some data, the webpage that is client facing would be the view.
