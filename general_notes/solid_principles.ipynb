    "So while this \"works\", this isn't ideal - we actually end up violating a number of S.O.L.I.D. principles doing this. For one, we've violated the Open-Closed principle as by adding a check for \"zombie\" we've modified the original `raise_dead` method. We've also violated the Interface Segregation Principle as well, as we're putting a bunch of functionality in `raise_dead` that might not always be used. (E.G., if we're only interested in raising skeletons, then the \"zombie\" code never gets used.) And finally, we've also violated the Single-Responsibility Principle as we're making `raise_dead` be responsible for raising several types of undead.\n",
