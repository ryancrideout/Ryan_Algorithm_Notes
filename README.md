# Ryan_Algorithm_Notes
Notes and examples of various algorithms and statistical models. This is just my repository where I compile notes that I think will be relevant to programming.

There's specific notes on statistics, algorithms and the like, and then there are more general notes.

# Jupyter
To run Jupyter, install the pipenv requirements and then type into your console `jupyter-lab`. That's it that's all you need.

For reference, you can find out more about Jupyter here: https://jupyter.org/
